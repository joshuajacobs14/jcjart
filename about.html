<p>
	JCJ (Jaspen Clay Jacobs) is a queer nonbinary American artist, designer, and social media content creator. 
	<br><br>
	JCJ briefly went viral on Tiktok (~2M views) in 2021 after making videos searching for their lost pet corn snake, Spaghetti, in their house. 
	The snake was found a month later. 
	They have also received some attention for their art and their videos about astrology/zodiac signs. 
	<br><br>
</p>
	<h2>Personal Life</h2>
<p>
	Jaspen Clay Jacobs was born Joshua Carl Jacobs, in Utah, September 1993. 
	JCJ was raised in the LDS church along with their ten siblings.
	<br><br>
	JCJ became interested in art at a young age. They attended many art classes in Jr High School and High School. 
	At the age of 16 they started working at a pizza restaurant. They also worked at a burger restaurant 
	and an amusement park. 
	<br><br>
	After High School, at age 19, JCJ went on a 2-year LDS mission in the Philippines, returning to Utah in 2014. 
	During their mission, JCJ experienced many illnesses including dengue fever in 2013 and a digestive system 
	infection in 2014 which led to long term conditions including lactose intolerance. 
	<br><br>
	After their mission, JCJ started attending LDS Business College (now Ensign College) for one year, 
	before transferring to Utah Valley University. They briefly studied business, web development, 
	web design, video game design, and digital media, before finally switching to Art & Design. 
	Due to the Covid pandemic, in March 2020 they quit their pursuit of a bachelor's degree and 
	graduated early with an associate's degree (AA). 
	<br><br>
	During college they started working at another pizza restaurant, then a grocery store, a bakery, 
	a sandwich restaurant, a call center, and an LGBT adult-entertainment website. 
	<br><br>
	JCJ came out of the closet as gay on social media in 2016, and they stopped attending church later that year. 
	In 2017 they had their name removed from the LDS church. In 2019 they came out as gender-queer 
	and in 2021 they came out as nonbinary. JCJ has said they prefere they/them pronouns, but are open to she, 
	and he pronouns as well. 
	<br><br>
	They have used their initials, JCJ, to sign artwork as early as high school. 
	In 2021 they started using their initials, JC(J), in more personal/professional settings. 
	In 2022 they began using the online nickname Jorts (queerjorts/uncutjorts). 
	And in late 2022 they chose the name Jaspen Clay Jacobs. 
	<br><br>
	In 2015 they started selling artwork under the business name "Art Joshua Studio" and in 
	2022 they changed it to "JCJ Art & Design". They sold LGBTQ themed artwork & merch at pride festivals 
	and farmers markets from 2017 to 2020. They have an Etsy shop and two Redbubble shops. 
	(Redbubble wouldn't let them change the name of the ArtJoshua shop so they created a second shop 
	called JCJArtDesign).

	"I am struggling to make ends meet right now and I would really appreciate any donation possible. 
	Thank you so much for your support of my art!"
